# Fabric-Workshop

Workshop Overview
*******************************************************************************************
This workshop provides hands-on experience on building end-to-end Analytics solutions leveraging Microsoft Fabric. 
Microsoft Fabric is redesigning how we work with data by bringing all your data and analysis tools into a single experience. Fabric moves away from individualized services to a unified stack, from a multiple databases to a unified data lake, from generative AI bolted on to generative AI simply built it.

Lab Scenarios
********************************************************************************************
This workshop is divided in 3 main sessions having appropriate labs:
1. The Foundational presentation will provide an overview of Fabric and the various workloads. Following the presentation, the team will work on the following labs:
	- [01-Lakehouse Lab](https://github.com/sagarbathe/Fabric-Workshop/tree/d87b18a01877827a1c1294ece6e1e8e0592321a5/1%20-%20Foundation/Discovery%20Labs/01-Lakehouse%20Lab)
	- [02 - Data Warehouse Lab](https://github.com/sagarbathe/Fabric-Workshop/tree/e0cfe3c98f11bc71a58d7c508dead6f7256b5cdc/1%20-%20Foundation/Discovery%20Labs/02%20-%20Data%20Warehouse%20Lab)
	- [03 - Real Time Analytics Lab](https://github.com/sagarbathe/Fabric-Workshop/tree/e0cfe3c98f11bc71a58d7c508dead6f7256b5cdc/1%20-%20Foundation/Discovery%20Labs/03%20-%20Real%20Time%20Analytics%20Lab) (Optional)
	- [04 - Data Science Lab](https://github.com/sagarbathe/Fabric-Workshop/tree/e0cfe3c98f11bc71a58d7c508dead6f7256b5cdc/1%20-%20Foundation/Discovery%20Labs/04%20-%20Data%20Science%20Lab) (Optional)

 2. This session will focus on Fabric Lakehouse and Data Engineering workload. The presentation will cover in-depth the Onelake architecture, various capabilities around security, performance optimization and ease of 
    development. Following the presentation, the team will work on creating an end-to-end Analytics solution utilizing the Fabric lakehouse based on a medallion architecture. Finally, they will create a semantic 
    model and sample Power BI Report. Following the presentation, the team will work on the following labs:
	- [Lab 1 - Create a Fabric workspace and data pipeline](https://github.com/sagarbathe/Fabric-Workshop/tree/6e6cadaae7ecc3b35c32dd1c101cbf771fb492dc/2%20-%20Lakehouse/Lab%201%20-%20Create%20a%20Fabric%20workspace%20and%20data%20pipeline)
	- [Lab 2 - Implement the Medallion Architecture](https://github.com/sagarbathe/Fabric-Workshop/tree/6e6cadaae7ecc3b35c32dd1c101cbf771fb492dc/2%20-%20Lakehouse/Lab%202%20-%20Implement%20the%20Medallion%20Architecture)
	- [Lab 3 - Create PBI reports](https://github.com/sagarbathe/Fabric-Workshop/tree/6e6cadaae7ecc3b35c32dd1c101cbf771fb492dc/2%20-%20Lakehouse/Lab%203%20-%20Create%20PBI%20reports)

 4. This session will focus on Data Factory capabilities such as Data Pipelines, Dataflow Gen2, advanced concepts and monitoring. Following the presentation, the team will work on developing Data Pipelines and 
    Dataflow Gen 2 artifacts. Following the presentation, the team will work on the following labs:
