# Fabric-Workshop

Workshop Overview
*******************************************************************************************
This workshop provides hands-on experience on building end-to-end Analytics solutions leveraging Microsoft Fabric. 
Microsoft Fabric is redesigning how we work with data by bringing all your data and analysis tools into a single experience. Fabric moves away from individualized services to a unified stack, from a multiple databases to a unified data lake, from generative AI bolted on to generative AI simply built it.
